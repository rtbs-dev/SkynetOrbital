# SkynetOrbital
Optimal Trajectory Sandbox for Machnine learning and Design Optimization

This project is a work-in-progress, which is not (yet) ready for the spotlight!
Currently working on reinforcement learning and bayesian optimization approaches to optimizing a 
flight-path to stable orbit. 

Eventually, this project aims to couple the design and control problems that people seem to do so 
naturally in game-play (think KSP or Besiege) and allow an optimization algorithm to tackle both design
and control in a non-nested manner!
